Stochastic optimization methods refer to the use and generation of random variables to compute solutions for complex combinatorial optimization problems. In computer science, there remains a major unsolved hypothesis called the \emph{"P versus NP problem"}, which discloses whether every problem whose solutions can be quickly verified, can also be quickly solved for. $P$ stands for polynomial time, which roughly means a set of relatively easy problems to be solved for. $NP$ stands for non-deterministic polynomial time which is a set of difficult problems to be solved for. So, if $P = NP$, this would imply that the difficult set of problems have relatively easily computed solutions. So we apply this onto a \emph{NP-hard} bioinformatics problem called the \emph{Phylogenetic Tree construction}, where we wish to explain the spread of the SARS Delta Coronavirus epidemic directly from 10 different DNA sequences \emph{(courtesy of the GenBank database owned by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) of USA, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)}. The issue that arises from having 10 genome samples is that, there are 34,459,425 binary rooted trees to choose from. Therefore we use a metaheuristic called the \emph{Genetic Algorithm}, which specializes in navigating massive search spaces to find the most optimal solution. This genetic algorithm is combined with another popular bioinformatics tool called the \emph{Multiple Sequence Alignment} which is in the form of a software called \emph{SAGA} or Sequence Alignment by Genetic Algorithm. By using this software in combination with one last algorithm used in our research, the \emph{Neighbor-joining} algorithm, we can find and produce an optimized tree to solve a NP-hard problem in O(log n) time complexities which are extremely efficient and computationally quick for a problem that would take a lifetime if brute-forced. This research is studying a small sample size, but is scratching the surface to understanding complex systems and problems, that we thought could never be solved ever.
